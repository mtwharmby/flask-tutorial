# flask-tutorial
This is just following the tutorial at http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/

Trying to teach myself flask (specifically how to do testing). If interested, probably better to look at the URL. See also: https://github.com/pallets/flask/tree/1.0.2/examples/tutorial

And this is probably going to get dropped somewhere soon anyway as I will get distracted with something else...
